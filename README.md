# Machine Learning Analysis of the Hepatitis Dataset

This repository contains the documentation of an experimental machine learning project focused on the analysis and classification of medical data related to hepatitis, using the UCI Hepatitis dataset.

---

## Overview
The project analyzes a medical dataset consisting of 155 patient records with 19 mixed features (categorical and numerical). The goal is to explore the dataset, handle missing values, and evaluate classification performance using different machine learning approaches.
